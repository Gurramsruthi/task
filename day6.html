<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish">fishes</a>Fish species are roughly divided equally between freshwater and marine (oceanic) ecosystems; there are some 15,200 freshwater species and around 14,800 marine species.[27] Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute the center of diversity for marine fishes,[28] whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo, and Mekong basins.[29] More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate species on the Earth.[30]
